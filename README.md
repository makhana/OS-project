# OS-project
Operating system project done at a course called Operating Systems 1 at School of Electrical Engineering, Belgrade.

It was built completely from scratch in C/C++ without any preexisting libraries (and no support for exceptions), put toggether to work on a RISC-V 64-bit processor using a host XV6 system, with minimal additional support.
